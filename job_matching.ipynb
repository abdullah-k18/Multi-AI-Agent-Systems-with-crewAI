            " San Francisco Bay Area, RemoteAI Fund – AI Fund /Contract /HybridWho we are: AI is the new electricity: Just as electricity transformed numerous industries starting 100 years ago, AI is now poised to do the same. AI Fund is a venture studio founded by Dr. Andrew Ng in 2017. Our portfolio companies use AI technology to build applications across numerous industry sectors. The AI Fund team combines their experiences as AI pioneers, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, investors, and operators.

Our purpose is to build AI companies that move humanity forward.What We’re Looking For:We’re seeking a Full-Stack Software Engineer, a true hacker, who thrives in extremely dynamic environments where the primary goal is to churn out functional prototypes in close coordination with small, scrappy cross-functional teams. The ideal candidate is experienced in both front-end and back-end development, comfortable working across the tech stack, and thrives in fast-paced environments where rapid prototyping and experimentation are key. This role focuses on building diverse, functional prototypes — so adaptability, creativity, and a broad technical skill set are key to success. If cranking out one to four new and modified prototype applications every day is exciting to you, this is the job for you.This is a contract position for candidates based in San Francisco, Bay Area.What You Will Do:Design, develop, and maintain both client-side and server-side components of a multitude of different applications with completely different objectives.Collaborate with cross-functional teams (e.g., product, design, QA) to build and iterate on prototypes that validate new ideas and user experiences.Build and integrate APIs and third-party services.Create and manage databases and ensure desired functionality.Participate in architecture discussions and technical planning.Identify and troubleshoot issues across the stack.Contribute to improving development processes, tools, and team practices.Stay current with industry trends and emerging technologies.What You Must Bring:3+ years of experience as a full-stack engineer or in a similar role.Proficiency in front-end technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.Experience in back-end development with Python.Familiarity with database technologies, both SQL (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB).Understanding of RESTful APIs and WebSockets.Experience with version control systems (e.g., Git) and collaborative workflows.Proficiency in deploying and managing applications on AWS.Strong command of containerization tools (e.g., Docker).Ability to write ugly, disposable, and poorly-documented code.Ability to write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code. Yes, this too!Strong problem-solving and communication skills.Communicate clearly and collaborate well with non-technical teammates.Insatiable curiosity and a love for solving tough problems.Nice To Haves:Experience with modern data querying protocols such as GraphQL, gRPC, or tRPC.Experience with serverless deployments.Experience with AI/ML products or tooling.At AI Fund, we are committed to providing an environment of mutual respect where equal employment opportunities are available to all applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy (including childbirth, lactation and related medical conditions), national origin, age, physical and mental disability, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, genetic information (including characteristics and testing), military and veteran status, and any other characteristic protected by applicable law.
